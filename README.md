# 📊 Loan Approval Analysis – End-to-End Project

## 🏆 Project Overview
This project analyzes **loan applications data** to understand approval trends and key factors affecting loan approval decisions.  
I used **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning, **SQL** for exploratory analysis, and **Power BI** for building an interactive dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)
- **SQL:**  Aggregations, Filtering, Grouping
- **Power BI:** DAX Measures, KPIs, Charts, Interactive Slicers
- **Domain Knowledge:** Credit Score, DTI (Debt-to-Income), Risk Score, Loan Purpose Analysis

---

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**
   - Handled missing values & outliers
   - Created new features: `CreditScoreCategory`, `AgeGroup`, `DTIRiskCategory`
   - Exported cleaned dataset for SQL & Power BI

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)**
   - Analyzed approval rate by Credit Score, Age Group, Loan Purpose
   - Calculated average loan amount, income distribution
   - Segmented customers by Risk Score & DTI

3. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Built KPIs: Total Applications, Approval Rate, Avg Loan Amount
   - Visuals: Approval split, Loan Amount by Credit Score, Age-wise Approvals, Loan Purpose Analysis
   - Created insights & recommendations for decision-makers

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Approval Rate:** 23.9% – strict screening process  
- **Top Age Group:** 36–45 → highest applications & approvals  
- **Home Loans:** Most popular but lower approval rates (high risk)  
- **High DTI (>40%):** Very low approval chances  
- **Fair Credit Score borrowers:** Largest share of loan disbursals

## 📑 Deliverables
- `Loan_Cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset  
- `SQL_Queries.sql` – All analysis queries  
- `Loan_Approval_Dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard  
- `Loan_Approval_Analysis_Report.pdf` – PDF report with KPIs & insights

## 💡 Learning Outcome
This project helped me combine **data cleaning, SQL analysis, and dashboard storytelling** into one end-to-end workflow — a perfect portfolio project for my resume.
